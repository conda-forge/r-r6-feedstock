  summary: Creates classes with reference semantics, similar to R's built-in reference classes.
    Compared to reference classes, R6 classes are simpler and lighter-weight, and they
    are not built on S4 classes so they do not require the methods package. These classes
    allow public and private members, and they support inheritance, even when the classes
    are defined in different packages.
